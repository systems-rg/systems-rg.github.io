# Winter systems school, IITD
**Supported by the Mohit Aron Endowment**

## About
We are excited to host the first winter systems school at CSE, IIT Delhi. We
will study two system areas: cybersecurity and cloud computing.

## Logistics
* **Duration**: Dec 4th-10th.
* **Eligibility**: Indian UG/PG students interested in systems. Must have
completed pre-requisite courses: OS and compilers.
* **Admissions**: We will conduct an online test. Details TBD.
* **Cohort size**: Upto 100 students. 4 students will be selected for doing a summer
internship.
* **Format**: In-class discussions, programming assignments providing hands-on
experience, and online discussion forums.
* **Financial support**: Lodging will be provided at the IIT Delhi campus
free-of-charge. Some funds are also available for reimbursing travel
expenditure.

> Please note that we will NOT give any certificate of completion and will
NOT provide recommendation letters to graduate schools or otherwise for
participating in the WSS.

## Tentative topics

### Cybersecurity:

Instructor: [Sorav Bansal](https://sorav.compiler.ai)

**Questions we will attempt to answer:**
* What are some known software defects that allow malicious hackers to take
control of a computer system?
* What are some common approaches that have been developed to prevent these
software defects?
* What are some automatic approaches and tools to try and uncover these defects
to be able to break into computer systems?  What are the high-level principles
behind these approaches?  What are the strengths and limitations of these
approaches?

**List of Topics:**

Known Software Defects:  Buffer overflow attacks, format-string vulnerabilities, SQL Injection Attacks, Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use Bugs, Timing-based Side Channels (e.g., Spectre), Compiler-based Attacks, …
Prevention Approaches: Use of Safe Languages, Safe Library Interfaces, Canaries, Address Space Layout Randomization, Compiler-Emitted Checks, Information Flow Tracking, …
Automatic Approaches and Tools: Fuzzing, Symbolic Execution, Use of Theorem Provers and Other Formal Methods, Dataflow Analyses on Source Code and Binary Executable, …


### Cloud computing:

Instructor: [Abhilash Jindal](https://abhilash-jindal.com)

**List of topics:**

* How to do batch computations at scale? MapReduce (Hadoop), Spark.
* How to do streaming computations at scale? Spark streaming, Flink.
* How to store data at scale? Google File system, Raft.
