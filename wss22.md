## About
We are excited to host the first winter systems school at CSE, IIT Delhi. We
will study two computer systems areas: cybersecurity, taught by [Sorav
Bansal](https://sorav.compiler.ai), and cloud computing, taught by [Abhilash
Jindal](https://abhilash-jindal.com). 

## Logistics
* **Venue:** The talks will be in Bharti 301 (2nd floor, Bharti building) and
the labs will be in LH504 and LH505 (5th floor, Lecture hall complex).
* **After winter school**: Selected students will also be offered
**paid internships at IIT Delhi** during summer 2023. Selected individuals will
also get interviewing opportunity with **[Microsoft
research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/)**
for Systems Research Fellow and for Systems Intern positions. MSR may skip some
of their interview rounds for these individuals.

> Please note that we will NOT give any certificate of completion and will
NOT provide recommendation letters to graduate schools or otherwise for
participating in the school.

## Inaugural talk
#### December 5th, 9-10:30 am

The school will be inaugurated by [Mohit
Aron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohit_Aron). Mohit has over 15 years of
experience building scalable, high-performance distributed systems, and has
been attributed as the father of hyperconvergence. Aron founded his current
company  Cohesity in 2013 and co-founded Nutanix in 2009. Prior to founding
Nutanix, Aron was at Google as a lead developer on the Google File System
engineering project. 

Among many prestigious awards, Cohesity has received since its inception,
Cohesity was named by the World Economic Forum (WEF) as one of the worldâ€™s 61
most promising Technology Pioneers 2018.

Aron graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University with a
focus on distributed systems. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India.

The title of his talk is "The Entrepreneurial Journey". It can be attended
online using [this
