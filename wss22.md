**Supported by the Mohit Aron Endowment**

## About
We are excited to host the first winter systems school at CSE, IIT Delhi. We
will study two computer systems areas: cybersecurity, taught by [Sorav
Bansal](https://sorav.compiler.ai), and cloud computing, taught by [Abhilash
Jindal](https://abhilash-jindal.com). 

## Logistics
* **After winter school**: Selected students will also be offered
**paid internships at IIT Delhi** during summer 2023. Selected individuals will
also get interviewing opportunity with **[Microsoft
research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/)**
for Systems Research Fellow and for Systems Intern positions. MSR may skip some
of their interview rounds for these individuals.

> Please note that we will NOT give any certificate of completion and will
NOT provide recommendation letters to graduate schools or otherwise for
participating in the school.

## Inaugural talk
The school will be inaugurated by [Mohit
Aron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohit_Aron). Mohit has over 15 years of
experience building scalable, high-performance distributed systems, and has
been attributed as the father of hyperconvergence. Aron founded his current
company  Cohesity in 2013 and co-founded Nutanix in 2009. Prior to founding
Nutanix, Aron was at Google as a lead developer on the Google File System
engineering project. 

Among many prestigious awards, Cohesity has received since its inception,
Cohesity was named by the World Economic Forum (WEF) as one of the world’s 61
most promising Technology Pioneers 2018.

Aron graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University with a
focus on distributed systems. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India.

The title of his talk is "The Entrepreneurial Journey".

### Cybersecurity:

**Questions we will attempt to answer:**
* What are some known software defects that allow malicious hackers to take
control of a computer system?
* What are some common approaches that have been developed to prevent these
software defects?
* What are some automatic approaches and tools to try and uncover these defects
to be able to break into computer systems?  What are the high-level principles
behind these approaches?  What are the strengths and limitations of these
approaches?

**List of Topics:**

* Known Software Defects:  Buffer overflow attacks, format-string
	vulnerabilities, SQL Injection Attacks, Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use Bugs,
	Timing-based Side Channels (e.g., Spectre), Compiler-based Attacks, …
* Prevention Approaches: Use of Safe Languages, Safe Library Interfaces,
	Canaries, Address Space Layout Randomization, Compiler-Emitted Checks,
	Information Flow Tracking, …
* Automatic Approaches and Tools: Fuzzing, Symbolic Execution, Use of Theorem
	Provers and Other Formal Methods, Dataflow Analyses on Source Code and Binary
	Executable, …
