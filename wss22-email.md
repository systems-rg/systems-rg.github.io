Please forward this to students.

We are excited to host the first winter systems school at CSE, IIT Delhi during 5th-9th  Dec. 2022. In the school, we will study two computer systems areas: cybersecurity and cloud computing. The school is open to UG and PG students in India.

The webpage of the winter systems school is at https://systems-rg.github.io/wss22.

You should apply only if you are interested in computer systems.  All applicants will be required to take an online test that would include questions on OS and Compilers, and will also include programming tests.  The programming tests can be taken either in Java or C++.  We will select a cohort of 80-100 students based on the online test.  The selected students will be offered free stay (with meals) in the IIT Delhi hostel for up to 5 days during 5th-9th Dec. 2022.

The applications are now open at https://forms.gle/HK2hMBmqv1nRpYQx8 until October 15th. The details of the online test will be communicated to the applicants over email.

Selected student attendees will also be offered paid summer internships at IIT Delhi in 2023. Selected individuals will also get interviewing opportunity with Microsoft research for Systems Research Fellow and for Systems Intern positions. MSR may skip some of their interview rounds for these individuals.

The school is supported by the Mohit Aron Endowment. The schedule includes an inaugural talk on the entrepreneurial journey by Mohit. Mohit is an IITD alumnus and has founded Cohesity and Nutanix.
