## About
We are excited to host the second winter systems school during 4-8 December 2023 at CSE, IIT Delhi. We
will study classic and contemporary topics in program analysis
and optimization: , taught by [Sorav
Bansal](https://sorav.compiler.ai) and [Kumar Madhukar](https://kumarmadhukar.github.io). 

## Logistics
* **Dates:** 4-8 December 2023
* **Venue:** The talks will be in the CSE department (Bharti building) and
the labs will be in LH504 and LH505 (5th floor, Lecture hall complex).
* **After winter school**: Selected students will also be offered
**paid internships at IIT Delhi** during summer 2024.

> Please note that we will NOT give any certificate of completion and will
NOT provide recommendation letters to graduate schools or otherwise for
participating in the school.
